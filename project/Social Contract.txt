Documentation
    Google Doc for now
    Professor likes documentation in txt format (turn all google docs into txt format and upload it to the github repository.)
etiquette (e.g. be on time, everyone’s ideas are important, don’t interject/interrupt)
    ALWAYS Create new branch every time new changes are made
    Before pushing add 2 reviewers to the requests before merged
    Communicate (if you can’t show up or do something, communicate that)
    Create a new branch every time you make new changes (even if it is just one file or one line of code).
    Before merging code to main, open a pull request, and assign TWO reviewers. Once BOTH reviewers have approved of the changes, you can merge your changes to main and close the PR.
    When you push code that completes a task for a specific issue (user story, defect, etc.), reference the issue in the commit message. ex: git commit -m “added sql query to get all users for issue #3”
    Don’t be rude/mean
keeping wall of work/assignments updated
    Check wall daily and describe the tasks as necessary
late work
    Don’t do it
    If necessary, communicate
